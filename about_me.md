Hi! I'm Georgia, a data scientist with an MPH in Epidemiology and 6 years of professional experience based in NYC. After founding and managing the data analytics team at my last company, I decided to pivot from management to an individual contributor path. I'm currently wrapping up my time in the Data Scientist Career Track at Springboard. 

### My top tools

### I'm seeking
- An impact driven project that supports healthcare, education, or the environment
- An individual contributor role in data science
- Opportunities to grow both individually and as part of a team
- A hybrid role on the East Coast would be ideal, though I'm open to in-person and fully remote arrangements if the opportunity is right 

### Some areas where I excel

- Designing educational tools and leading training
- Team leadership
- Stakeholder communication
- Puzzles :)
